[Try it out on a free dummy site](https://bsf.io/fullwidth-templates-demo)

**Blank Template**

*   Removes header, footer, sidebar, comments, title and leaves you with a plain canvas
*   Awesome for landing pages where you need complete control over your layout

**Full Width Template**  

*   Removes Sidebar, page title, comments and stretches the layout to full width
*   Ideal if you're using a Page Builder

**Bonus - No Sidebar Template**  

*   Just Removes Sidebar
*   Perfect if your theme does not have No Sidebar option.
*   Rest of the layout & styling will remain intact.

  
**Made to work with Page Builders**  
When you're using a Page Builder, things like the default page title, boxed layout, extra margin and padding usually get in your way. This plugin puts you in absolute control and removes all unnecessary elements from your layout.

**Dead Simple**  
It adds three simple options for your pages & posts. Just choose the one and you should be all set.

**Potable & No Lock-in**  
If you're anything like us, you care what happens when you switch your themes. Generally changing theme means, you will need to edit all your pages and change templates. But if you're using a plugin like this - you won't have to worry about it.

**Supported & Actively Developed**
